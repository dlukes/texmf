                  finite-state transducers (using the freely available OpenFst), together with
                  detailed documentation and scripts for building complete recognition systems.
                  Kaldi is written is C++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary
                  phonetic-context sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace Gaussian mixture models
                  (SGMM) as well as standard Gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly
                  used linear and affine transforms. Kaldi is released under the Apache License
