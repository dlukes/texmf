                  finite-state transducers (using the freely available OpenFst), together with
                  detailed documentation and scripts for building complete recognition systems.
                  Kaldi is written is C++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary
                  phonetic-context sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace Gaussian mixture models
                  (SGMM) as well as standard Gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly
